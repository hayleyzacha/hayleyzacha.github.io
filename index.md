## Who is *Hayley Zacha*?

I am a senior college student at *Liberty University* studying **Web and Mobile Programming**.  I reside in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas area. I began playing with computers at a young age. Microsoft Excel is my most used application program and I use it every day to balance my student life, homeschool and family life for my three young children, and my work and creative life. In 2013, I accepted a position as a data wiper for a consumer electronics company. I quickly learned how to disasemble, solder components, and refurbish Apple iPods. I began studying Information Technology after two years of General Studies. I'm truly excited to learn everything I can programming wise.
